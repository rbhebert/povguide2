Federal Poverty Guidelines by family size

This is an extension of the original Stata module POVGUIDE by David Kantor written to include guideline data from 2009-2023, whereas the original module stopped at 2008. We do not include Alaska and Hawaii values for the guidelines, only 48 contiguous US states.
